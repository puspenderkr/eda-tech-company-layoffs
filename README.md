### Overview

This repository contains data and code for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on tech company layoffs. Layoffs in the tech industry are a significant and often complex aspect of business operations. This EDA is designed to help you gain insights and understanding from available data regarding layoffs in tech companies.


## Data Sources

 - Layoff Data: The primary dataset used in this analysis is [data source here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salimwid/technology-company-layoffs-20222023-data?select=tech_layoffs.csv).
